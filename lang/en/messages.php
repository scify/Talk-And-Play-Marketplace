        <p><strong>2.1 Stimulus - Reaction</strong></p>
        <p>The goal here is for the user to press a button on the keyboard and see something happen on the screen as a result. This way they combine the stimulus (pressing a button) with the reaction (something happening on the screen).</p>
        <p>The images that make up the games of this category must be simple and attractive to the end-user.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 12px"><strong>2.2 Time Sequence</strong></p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px">In the games of this category, the user sees a number of images that they have to put in order according to what happened first. Let’s see an example:</p>
        <img src="img/time-sequence-example.png"  alt=""; style="top: 1345px;left: 278px; width: 661px; height: 160px; ">
        <p style="font-size: 18px; font-style:italic; color: var(--content-orange); font-family: "Open Sans",sans-serif">In the game above we see the life course of a flower. The user has to place the last image first, the second-to-last second, and so on.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 12px"><strong>2.3 Find the Similar</strong></p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px">In this game, the user has to click on the image that is similar to the image at the lower part of the screen. Let’s see an example:</p>
        <img src="img/find-similar-example.png"  alt=""; style="top: 1631px;left: 275px; width: 580px; height: 259px; ">
